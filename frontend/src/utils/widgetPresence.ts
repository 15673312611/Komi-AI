 * It used to be the hardcoded "Online · replies instantly" — asserted at 3am
 * with everyone logged off, on an agent whose AI never answers. What the widget
 * may honestly claim depends on who has to reply:
 *
 * - the AI answers → it really is instant, around the clock
 * - a person has to answer → only true inside the organization's business hours
 *
 * Availability is decided server-side from business hours alone. `is_online` is
 * set at login and cleared only on logout or a manual toggle, so it reports
 * people who closed a tab days ago as present.
