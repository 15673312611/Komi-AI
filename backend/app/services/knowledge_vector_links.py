Keeps the agent_id list inside the vector store in step with the relational
knowledge_to_agents links.

Retrieval filters on `filters->'agent_id'`, so a link row that never reaches the
vector store is invisible to the agent: the dashboard shows the source as linked
while the agent cannot retrieve a single chunk of it. Both directions live here
so link and unlink cannot drift apart.
