Encryption of user content at rest.

Conversation content (chat messages, AI-written session summaries, the agno agent
memory blob) is stored as ciphertext so that a database dump, a stolen backup or a
stray `psql` session does not expose it. The application decrypts transparently.

Stored format is ``enc:<key_id>:<fernet-token>``. The key id is what makes key
rotation possible without a schema change: a future key is added to KEYS as ``v2``,
CURRENT_KEY_ID moves to it, and ``v1`` stays in the registry so old rows keep
reading while a backfill re-encrypts them.

This module deliberately depends on nothing but the standard library, cryptography,
SQLAlchemy and app.core.{logger,config} (both light), so the backfill script can load
it by file path on the host without importing the `app` package — whose __init__
pulls in the FastAPI app and the whole ML stack.
